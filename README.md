# BMI CALCULATOR
**BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure used to assess whether an individual has a healthy body weight for their height. It’s commonly used in health and fitness assessments to categorize individuals into weight categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.**

Formula for BMI
Metric Units:

𝐵𝑀𝐼= Weight (kg)/Height (m)^2

Example: If a person weighs 70 kg and is 1.75 m tall:
𝐵𝑀𝐼=Weight (lbs)×703/Height (inches)*
​
Example: If a person weighs 154 lbs and is 68 inches tall:

𝐵𝑀𝐼= (154×703)/(68)^2 ≈ 23.39
